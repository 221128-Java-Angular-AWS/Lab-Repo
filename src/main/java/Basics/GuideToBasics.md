The purpose of this package is a refresher on basics that are universal across programming languages: you will always encounter arrays, boolean expressions, and control flow. This knowledge can be considered prerequisite to project work of any kind.

None of the solutions to this repo need to be longer than a single line. You can skip this section if you feel you don't need the practice.
