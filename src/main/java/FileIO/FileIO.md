# File IO Problems
The problems in this repo are thematically somewhere in between Core and Challenges.

They require knowledge about how file I/O works, which you will have to read and experiment with on your own. The files that will be read/modified are located in src/main/resources/Files. If you have accidentally wrote to a file you weren't supposed to, this could break a test case, and you should replace the file with the original contents from GitHub.

The problems in this section resemble "real" software work more than the challenges or core sections.

No. of problems: 6
